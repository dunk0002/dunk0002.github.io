	<h2>About Me</h2>
    I grew up in Edmond, Oklahoma. While in high school, I was involved in the marching band for four years. My third and fourth years I held a leadership position as the band council historian. The band council helped plan social events. I graduated from Edmond North High School with a 4.0 GPA as a Valedictorian with Distinction. This distinction is given to someone who passes at least five Advanced Placement courses.

	After high school, I came to the University of Oklahoma with intentions of being a Sports Business major. While taking some business courses, I learned I had a passion for MIS and added that to become a double major student. With my passion for internal operations of sports teams, MIS was a natural fit to help achieve my dream. That dream being working in internal operations for athletics.
